# Researcher Influence Prediction using Academic Genealogy Graph
In this work, we proposed the task of Researcher Influence Prediction (ResIP) to predict researchersâ€™ future influence in an academic field by modelling the researcher academic lineage growth. To address
the ResIP, a number of end-to-end deep learning architectures have been proposed.
